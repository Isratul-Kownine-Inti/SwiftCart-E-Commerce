## Question/Answers

1. What is the difference between null and undefined?
Ans: In JavaScript, when we declare a variable but don't assign any value to it then it shows undefined .It's type also undefined .on the other hand, Null is an object and it is set by developer intentionally when he/she wants to represent an empty value. It is a historical bug in JS.
A developer should never set undefined as a value of a variable instead they can use Null if needed.
